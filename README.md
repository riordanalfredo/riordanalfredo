I am proficient in the design and development process, especially in the software architecture (design patterns, quality assurance, and human dynamics) with a couple years of industry experience.

### Hello! 👋

My name is Riordan 👨‍🚀, and I am a full-stack software engineer (freelancer) and teaching associate at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. I teach Software Engineering core units:
- FIT2099: Object Oriented Design and Implementation, 
- FIT2101: Software Engineering Process and Management, 
- FIT3170: Software Engineering Practice

In teaching, I have successfully mentored students in developing & publishing several web applications. I love connecting with my students aside from just delivering contents. Now, I am mentoring and leading several interesting projects:
- Flexible web framework for research groups' landing page (multi-tenant architecture)
- Unblind the Android Apps with Deep Learning.
- Auto-marking software

At the same time, I am working on various software projects with `ReactJS`, `Redux`, `MobX`, `Quantlib`, `NodeJS`, `Gatsby`, `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`, and `Django` frameworks.

## TLDR;
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Gatsby [blog](rioalfredo.com), Django ERP project, and MERN stack project.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Management (Learning) to pursue my dream - having a company that teach software/programming!
- 💬 Ask me about Software Engineering, Leadership, ReactJS development, Full-stack development, Deep learning, etc.
