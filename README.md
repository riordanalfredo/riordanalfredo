I am proficient in the design and development process, especially in the software architecture (design patterns, quality assurance, and human dynamics) with a couple years of industry experience.

### Hello! 👋

My name is Riordan 👨‍🚀! I am a research software engineer (research assistant) and teaching associate at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. I teach software engineering core units:
- FIT2099: Object Oriented Design and Implementation, 
- FIT2101: Software Engineering Process and Management, 
- FIT3170: Software Engineering Practice

In teaching, I have successfully guided and led students in developing & publishing web applications for their professional portfolio. I always establish positive relationship and bring safe environment in the class. Now, I am working on several projects:
- Webpage Development for the Academic Research Group (`MERN stack`) - Mentor & QA engineer
- Unblind Your App: Automatically Voicing Inaccessible Mobile Apps (`Android`, `Talkback API`, and `TensorFlow Lite`) - Mentor
- Real time data capturing system for Multimodal Learning Analytics in clinical simulations (`Java`, `Confluent Cloud`, and `Apache Kafka`)- Research assistant/developer
- Dropshipping system (`ReactJS` and `Spring MVC`) - Solo lead software engineer

I am also assisting my teaching team as a co-mentor in the following projects:
- Auto-marking system 
- Visual Testing Platform for Android Apps 
- Web portal for environmental monitoring in building environments 
- Development of an Android mobile application to communicate with wearable health monitoring patches

## TLDR;
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Gatsby [blog](rioalfredo.com), Apache Kafka, Dropshipping system with Spring MVC, MERN stack project.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Management (Learning) to pursue my dream - owning an educational private company to teach software engineering/programming!
