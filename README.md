> Software engineering has always fascinated me. It covers all levels of complexity that satisfies my hunger for knowledge. The true challenge comes not only from the technology side but also from understanding business needs and people. I am proficient in the design and development process, especially in the software architecture (design patterns, quality assurance, and human dynamics) through academic research and industry experience.

### Hello! 👋

My name is Riordan (Rio) 👨‍🚀! I am a research officer and teaching associate at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. I teach software engineering core units:
- [FIT2099: Object Oriented Design and Implementation](https://handbook.monash.edu/2022/units/FIT2099) - Educational Content Developer & Lead TA, 
- [FIT2101: Software Engineering Process and Management](https://handbook.monash.edu/2021/units/FIT2101), 
- [FIT3077: Software Engineering: Architecture and Design](https://handbook.monash.edu/2022/units/FIT3077) - Admin TA 
- [FIT3170: Software Engineering Practice](https://handbook.monash.edu/2022/units/FIT3170) - Mentor

In teaching, I have successfully guided and led students in developing & publishing web applications for their professional portfolio. I always establish positive relationship and bring fun environment in the class. 

Now, I am working on several professional and personal projects, as follows:
- Real time data capturing system for Multimodal Learning Analytics in clinical simulations (`Java`, `Confluent Cloud`, and `Apache Kafka`)- Research assistant/developer
- [Interactive Writing Tool](https://iwt.software) - Lead Software Engineer
- Microservices ERP (`MERN`, `Spring MVC`, `Django`, `AWS` ) - CTO

I am also assisting my teaching team as a co-mentor in the following projects:
- Webpage Development for the Academic Researchers (`MERN stack`) - Mentor & QA engineer
- Unblind Your App: Automatically Voicing Inaccessible Mobile Apps (`Android`, `Talkback API`, and `TensorFlow Lite`) - Mentor
- Auto-marking system 
- Visual Testing Platform for Android Apps 
- Web portal for environmental monitoring in building environments 
- Development of an Android mobile application to communicate with wearable health monitoring patches
- [and more!](https://github.com/Monash-FIT3170)

## TLDR;
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Microservices and IoT projects with various stacks.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying PhD in Learning Analytics to pursue my dream: owning an educational private company to generate competent software engineers!
