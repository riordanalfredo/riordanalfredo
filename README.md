> Software engineering has always fascinated me. It covers all levels of complexity that satisfies my hunger for knowledge. The true challenge comes not only from the technology side but also from understanding business needs. The true challenge comes not only from the technology sides but also from understanding business needs. I am proficient in the design and development process, especially in the software architecture (design patterns, quality assurance, and human dynamics) with a couple years of industry experience.

### Hello! 👋

My name is Riordan 👨‍🚀! I am a research software engineer (research assistant) and teaching associate at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. I teach software engineering core units:
- FIT2099: Object Oriented Design and Implementation, 
- FIT2101: Software Engineering Process and Management, 
- FIT3170: Software Engineering Practice

In teaching, I have successfully guided and led students in developing & publishing web applications for their professional portfolio. I love connecting with my students aside from delivering contents. Now, I am working on several projects:
- Webpage Development for the Academic Research Group (`MERN stack`) - Mentor & QA engineer
- Unblind Your App: Automatically Voicing Inaccessible Mobile Apps (`Android`, `Talkback API`, and `TensorFlow Lite`) - Mentor
- Data capturing system for Multimodal Learning Analytics in clinical simulations (`Java`, `Confluent Cloud`, and `Apache Kafka`)- Research assistant/developer
- Dropshipping system (`ReactJS` and `Spring MVC`) - Lead software engineer

I am also assisting other teaching staffs as a co-mentor in the following projects:
- Auto-marking system 
- Visual Testing Platform for Android Apps 
- Web portal for environmental monitoring in building environments 
- Development of an Android mobile application to communicate with wearable health monitoring patches

At the same time, I am working on various software projects with `ReactJS`, `Redux`, `MobX`, `Quantlib`, `NodeJS`, `Gatsby`, `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`, and `Django` frameworks.

## TLDR;
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Gatsby [blog](rioalfredo.com), Apache Kafka with Java, Spring MVC dropshipping system project, MERN stack project.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Management (Learning) to pursue my dream - owning an educational private company to teach software/programming!
- 💬 Ask me about Software Engineering, Leadership, ReactJS development, Full-stack development, Deep learning, etc.
