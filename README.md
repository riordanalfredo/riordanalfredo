### Hello! 👋

<!--
**riordanalfredo/riordanalfredo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

My name is Riordan, and I am a full-stack software engineer and Teaching Associate at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. I teach Software Engineering core units:
- FIT2099: Object Oriented Design and Implementation, 
- FIT2101: Software Engineering Process and Management, 
- FIT3170: Software Engineering Practice
In teaching, I love connecting with all of my students aside from just delivering content. I have successfully assisted students in developing & publishing several web applications. Now I have several interesting projects that I am mentoring:
- Flexible web framework for research groups' landing page
- Unblind the Android Apps with Deep Learning.

At the same time, I am working on various software projects with `ReactJS`, `Redux`, `MobX`, `Quantlib`, `NodeJS`, `Gatsby`, `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`, and `Django` frameworks.

Software engineering has always fascinated me. It covers all levels of complexity that satisfies my hunger for knowledge. The true challenge comes not only from the technology side but also from understanding business needs. he true challenge comes not only from the technology sides but also from understanding business needs. I am proficient in the design and development process, especially in the software architecture (design patterns, quality assurance, and human dynamics) with a couple years of industry experience.

I received a full-ride scholarship to study data science & AI area as a Doctor of Philosophy student at Monash University, in 2020. My research was about meta-learning & recommender systems topics. But, my career direction is redirected back to the software development and software engineering.
