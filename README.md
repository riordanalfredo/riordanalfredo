> Software engineering has always fascinated me. It encompasses a vast spectrum of complexities, particularly in software architecture, design patterns, quality assurance, and human dynamics, that satiate my intellectual curiosity. The intrigue lies not merely in the technological aspects but also in understanding business requirements and human interactions. My proficiency in design and development has been honed through rigorous academic research in human-centred learning analytics and hands-on industry experience. This blend of knowledge and practical skills empowers me to navigate the multifaceted landscape of information and computer technology with confidence and finesse, especially in education technology. 

### Hello! 👋

My name is Riordan (Rio) 👨‍🚀! I am a research officer and teaching associate at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. I teach software engineering core units:
- [FIT2099: Object Oriented Design and Implementation](https://handbook.monash.edu/2022/units/FIT2099) - Educational Content Developer & Lead TA, 
- [FIT2101: Software Engineering Process and Management](https://handbook.monash.edu/2021/units/FIT2101), 
- [FIT3077: Software Engineering: Architecture and Design](https://handbook.monash.edu/2022/units/FIT3077) - Admin TA 
- [FIT3170: Software Engineering Practice](https://handbook.monash.edu/2022/units/FIT3170) - Mentor

In teaching, I have successfully guided and led students in developing & publishing web applications for their professional portfolios. I always establish positive relationships and bring a fun environment to the class. 

Now, I am working on several professional and personal projects, as follows:
- Real time data capturing system for Multimodal Learning Analytics in clinical simulations (`Java`, `Confluent Cloud`, and `Apache Kafka`)- Research assistant/developer
- [Interactive Writing Tool](https://iwt.software) - Lead Software Engineer
- Microservices ERP (`MERN`, `Spring MVC`, `Django`, `AWS` ) - CTO

I am also assisting my software engineering teaching team as a co-mentor in the following projects:
- Webpage Development for the Academic Researchers (`MERN stack`) - Mentor & QA engineer
- Unblind Your App: Automatically Voicing Inaccessible Mobile Apps (`Android`, `Talkback API`, and `TensorFlow Lite`) - Mentor
- Auto-marking system 
- Visual Testing Platform for Android Apps 
- Web portal for environmental monitoring in building environments 
- Development of an Android mobile application to communicate with wearable health monitoring patches
- [and more!](https://github.com/Monash-FIT3170)

## TLDR;
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Microservices and IoT projects with various stacks.
- 🌱 I’m studying PhD in Learning Analytics to pursue my dream: running a private educational training centre to generate competent software engineers and AI developers!
